<h1>Hi thereðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>My name is Rahul, and I have over 10 years of experience in Core PHP, Laravel, and WordPress. I have developed extensive websites capable of handling 1000+ services and effectively managing high user traffic. My strong suit lies in customization. I have worked on websites where we added customizations through theme templates and developed helper plugins to incorporate new functionalities without affecting plugin updates.</p>

<p>My expertise in PHP enables me to quickly identify and resolve critical issues. Proficiency in Core PHP is crucial for pinpointing and addressing the root causes of bugs. I excel in optimizing websites and resolving load-balancing issues. I am also well-versed in on-page SEO, integration of payment gateways, Google Analytics, CDN implementation, and have successfully incorporated these features into PHP & WordPress websites.</p>

<p>My expertise covers the following skills: Laravel, Core PHP, WordPress Development, Plugin and Theme Customization, Bug Fixing, Website Optimization, Custom Panel Development, API Development and Integration, and Responsive Web Design.
