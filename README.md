I excel in optimizing websites and resolving load-balancing issues. I am also well-versed in on-page SEO, integration of payment gateways, Google Analytics, CDN implementation, and have successfully incorporated these features into PHP & WordPress websites.</p>

<p>My expertise covers the following skills: Laravel, Core PHP, WordPress Development, Plugin and Theme Customization, Bug Fixing, Website Optimization, Custom Panel Development, API Development and Integration, and Responsive Web Design.
